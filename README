DESCRIPTION
------------
seviri_native_util is a C library that provides functionality to read, write,
and pre-process SEVIRI image data in the Native SEVIRI Level 1.5 format
distributed by U-MARF.  It reads the level 1.5 files into a data structure,
including the U-MARF header, the level 1.5 header, the image data (in 10 bit
pixel counts), and the level 1.5 trailer.  Files with specially selected
rectangular regions relative to the entire disk are fully supported.

The user may select any subset of channels to read and may select a rectangular
region to read in either in pixel coordinates (relative to an entire SEVIRI
disk) or in latitude and longitude.  Rectangular selection is supported for
both full disk files or files with a previously selected region.

Once read in, the data can then be accessed, changed (subsetted, calibrated,
etc.) and/or written to a new file.  In addition, the data may be preprocessed
to obtain, radiance, reflectance, and/or brightness temperature, for any set of
channels, along with pixel time, latitude, longitude, solar zenith angle, solar
azimuth angle, sensor viewing zenith angle, and sensor viewing azimuth angle.


INSTALLATION
------------
The source maybe obtained by git cloning from github.com with ...

The main code is C89 compliant and is dependent only on the C standard library.
 As such, it should compile with any modern C compiler and probably with most
C++ compilers.  A simple GNU Makefile exists in which the compiler and its
options can be changed.  The default setup is for GCC and should work on any
Linux or MacOS systems with programming tools installed and probably most
modern UNIX systems.  In this case executing `make' in the source code
directory will compile the code.

For other platforms/environments, such as MS Windows Visual C++, it is up to
user to set up the build within that platform/environment.

After the build the relevant header and library file will be located in the
same directory as the source.  It is up to the user to move these to or link to
these from other locations.

In addition to the C interface seviri_native_util has a Fortran interface that
provides access to the most important functionality.  If the Fortran interface
is desired uncomment the indicated line in the Makefile and adjust the Fortran
compiler and options as desired.  The default setup is for GFortran.


USAGE
-----
seviri_native_util is meant to be used by a larger program requiring access to
SEVIRI Level 1.5.  It is not a standalone program and as such must be linked
with other programs.

Working example programs for both C and Fortran are included with the
distribution 'example_c' and 'example_f90'.  These are fully commented in the
code and should be enough to get started using seviri_native_util.  These
programs take a single argument: a MSG2-SEVI-MSG15-* filename, read sub-images
of reflectance in two bands and brightness temperature in two bands, and print
the values for the central pixel.
